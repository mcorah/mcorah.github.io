## **Talking Robotics:** Active Perception and Exploration with Teams of Robots --- From Simulation to Subterranean

This seminar talk presents most of the work from my thesis along with a brief
discussion of my time at JPL competing in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge.
I discuss topics such as mutual information objectives for exploration,
algorithms for distributed perception planning in multi-robot teams,
and scalable planning for target tracking problems.

## Scalable Distributed Planning for Multi-Robot, Multi-Target Tracking *(IROS 2021)*

This work applies Randomized Sequential Partitions (RSP) to multi-robot,
multi-target tracking with a mutual information objective.
RSP is a distributed algorithm for sensor and perception planning and an
approximation algorithm for submodular maximization problems.
The analysis in this work develops new bounds for mutual information objectives
that form a sum over targets, and
the results focus on scaling to large teams and demonstrate receding-horizon
planning for a team of 96 robots.

## Volumetric Objectives for Multi-Robot Exploration of Three-Dimensional Environments *(ICRA 2021)*

This work contrasts coverage-based and information-theoretic perception
objectives for exploration (autonomous mapping) and attempts to unify these two
bodies of work.
Our analysis indicates that coverage objectives can be good approximations for
information-theoretic quantities, and initial simulation results indicate that
coverage-based objectives can provide significantly better exploration
performance than existing beam-based mutual information objectives, particularly
when accounting for multiple observations.
