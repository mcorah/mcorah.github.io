**I will be joining the Colorado School of Mines [CS@Mines](https://cs.mines.edu/)
as an Assistant Professor in January 2024.**
My group will study aerial robotics, active perception, and multi-robot systems
with applications to aerial videography, infrastructure inspection, and search
(mines safety, search and rescue).
*Please feel free to reach out directly if you would be interested in working
with me at a graduate or undergraduate level or otherwise
(starting with the 2023--2024 application cycle).*
I expect to be involved with students in Computer Science, Robotics, and
Mechanical Engineering (pending a courtesy appointment);
and I would encourage students to consider the
[robotics program](https://robotics.mines.edu/)
and our other excellent faculty!

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie
Mellon
University, working in the [AirLab](https://theairlab.org/).
My work here focuses on [filming and reconstruction moving agents with
groups of aerial robots](https://theairlab.org/multidrone/).
This is relevant to applications such as sports cinematography,
biomechanics, study of animal groups, and filming improvisational performations.


Before that I was a postdoc at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and competed
with team [CoSTAR](https://costar.jpl.nasa.gov/) in the DARPA Subterranean
Challenge where I focused on aerial navigation in challenging, underground
environments.

I received my Ph.D. also from CMU in 2020, working in
[RISLab](https://rislab.org/).
My thesis proposed RSP
([Julia](https://github.com/mcorah/MultiAgentSensing),
[C++](https://github.com/mcorah/distributed_randomized_sequential_partitions))
a *scalable, distributed submodular maximization algorithm for
perception planning with teams of robots* with applications to autonomous
exploration for mapping of three-dimensional environments as well as perception
planning with multi-robot teams.

As for myself, I enjoy outdoor activities such as cycling, rock climbing, and
an occasional round of disc golf.
I am also an avid music listener!
I attend concerts when I can, and while metal is central to my taste, I also
enjoy a variety of rock, pop, hip-hop, and experimental artists.
*Feel free to discuss to discuss any of these with me if we meet!*
