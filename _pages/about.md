**I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at
the Colorado School of Mines and director of the
[Navigation, Aerial-robots, and Perception Planning Laboratory (NAPPLab)](https://www.napplab.org/).**
We study aerial robotics, active perception, and multi-robot systems
with applications to aerial videography, infrastructure inspection,
and physical search (mine safety, search and rescue).

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie
Mellon
University, in the [AirLab](https://theairlab.org/)
where I focuse on [filming and reconstruction moving agents with
groups of aerial robots](https://theairlab.org/multidrone/).
This work is relevant to applications such as sports cinematography,
biomechanics, study of animal groups, and filming improvisational performations.


Before that I was a postdoc at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and competed
with team [CoSTAR](https://costar.jpl.nasa.gov/) in the DARPA Subterranean
Challenge where I focused on aerial navigation in challenging, underground
environments.

I received my Ph.D. also from CMU in 2020, working in
[RISLab](https://rislab.org/).
My thesis proposed RSP
([Julia](https://github.com/mcorah/MultiAgentSensing),
[C++](https://github.com/mcorah/distributed_randomized_sequential_partitions))
a *scalable, distributed submodular maximization algorithm for
perception planning with teams of robots* with applications to autonomous
exploration for mapping of three-dimensional environments as well as perception
planning with multi-robot teams.

As for myself, I enjoy outdoor activities such as cycling, rock climbing, and
an occasional round of disc golf.
I am also an avid music listener.
I attend concerts when I can, and while metal is central to my taste, I also
enjoy a variety of rock, pop, hip-hop, and experimental artists.
*Feel free to discuss to discuss any of these with me if we meet!*

## Prospective students

_Please refer to the [NAPPLab site](https://www.napplab.org/contact.html)
regarding joining or working with us!_

I expect to be involved with students in Computer Science, Robotics, and
Mechanical Engineering (pending a courtesy appointment);
and I would encourage students to consider the
[robotics program](https://robotics.mines.edu/)
and our other excellent faculty!

I am looking for students a variety of backgrounds in areas such as computer
science, engineering, physics, or applied mathematics.
Depending on your background and interests, we might work primarily with
math and theory, with aerial and mobile robots in lab settings (motion capture),
or eventually toward field deployments such as at the
[Edgar Experimental Mine](https://mining.mines.edu/edgar-experimental-mine/).
