* **Kind and constructive feedback:**
Constructive feedback describes how a person can improve their self or
something they have created or reinforces what has been done well.
Kind feedback seeks to mitigate harm when providing feedback.
These two are not mutually exclusive.
* **Empathetic mentorship:**
I seek to understand the goals and needs of the people I advise or mentor.
While I often have personal or external goals in mind, I try to find alignment
for those I am working with.
* **Inclusion:**
I do not discriminate based on
nationality, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or religion.
I seek to provide inclusive environments personally and in the projects I lead
or the events that I organize.
* **Societal impact:**
Topics I study such as aerial robotics and active perception are often fraught
with ethical and societal challenges
e.g. person or object tracking is central to many aerial robotics applications,
but developing these technologies could contribute to ever more pervasive
surveillance.
I try to be honest in stating that the contributions of my research can have
capacity to help or to harm.
At the same time, micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) have yielded positive impacts.
MAVs are at the center of a vibrant hobbyist community, are transforming
cinematography.

### Why did I create this page?

This page express what I expect of myself.
It also provides a standard for what others should expect of me.
Further, this is an opportunity for me to invite
[feedback](mailto:micahcorah@gmail.com)---please let me know if
you feel that I am not living up to the values listed here or if there is
anything I should change to improve this page or myself.

I started becoming more aware of people and organizations expressing values
on their websites sometime in 2021.
Now, I have some tendency to cynicism: a company can list any sort of values and
aspirations on their website, and lip-service to safety or sustainability can be
purely performative and self-congratulatory.
However, my perspective has evolved---web pages describing values can perform
some useful functions.
First, as I have already emphasized, pages such as this
*communicate a standard* that a person or organization can aspire to or be
evaluated by and thereby *invites feedback*.
Second, a page describing values can *provide useful or actionable information*.
The website for the autonomous deliver company
[nuro](https://www.nuro.ai/)
(which includes pages on Service, Safety, Communities, and Sustainability),
was one of the first to stand out to me and provides some examples of what I
mean.
Nuro's website emphasizes their relationship to the communities in which they
operate while providing people in those communities with channels to provide
feedback.
Other pages provide information on topics such as safety features or the legal
basis for their operation and include both clear summaries and links to
documents with detailed descriptions.
