* **Kind and constructive feedback:**
Constructive feedback describes how a person can improve their self or
something they have created or reinforces what has been done well.
Kind feedback seeks to mitigate harm when providing feedback.
These two are not mutually exclusive.
* **Empathetic mentorship:**
I seek to understand the goals and needs of the people I advise or mentor.
While I often have personal or external goals in mind, I try to find alignment
for those I am working with.
* **Inclusion:**
I seek to provide a welcoming environment to students of any
nationality, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or religion.
When I make a decision on whether to work with a new student project,
I focus first on alignment in interests and goals
* **Societal impact:**
Topics I study such as aerial robotics and active perception are often fraught
with ethical and societal challenges
e.g. person or object tracking is central to many aerial robotics applications,
but developing these technologies could contribute to ever more pervasive
surveillance.
I try to be honest in stating that the contributions of my research can have
capacity to help or to harm.
At the same time, micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) have yielded positive impacts.
MAVs are at the center of a vibrant hobbyist community, are transforming
cinematography.
