* **Kind and constructive feedback:**
Constructive feedback describes how a person can improve their self or
something they have created or reinforces what they have done well.
Kind feedback seeks encourage the recipient and to mitigate harm.
These two are not mutually exclusive.
<br><br>
* **Empathetic mentorship:**
I seek to understand the goals and needs of the people I advise or mentor.
I realize that my peers and students have varied goals and values that are
distinct from my own.
While I often have personal or external goals in mind, I work to find alignment
toward those I am working with.
<br><br>
* **Inclusion:**
I seek to provide a welcoming environment to students of any
nationality, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or religion.
This is an active process involving how I interact with potential peers or
collaborators and how I inspect my own biases.
<br><br>
* **Collaboration:**
I am open to collaboration and value transparent communication.
Although much of my work has been completed on an individual basis, even my most
solitary works have benefitted greatly from influence by peers working on
related topics.
I value contributions from peers with different backgrounds and from other
subject areas, and I am excited to make my work increasingly collaborative.
<br><br>
* **Societal impact:**
Topics in robotics and specifically aerial robotics and active perception are
subject to a variety ethical and societal challenges
e.g. person or object tracking is central to many aerial robotics applications,
but developing these technologies could contribute, for example, to realization
of pervasive surveillance systems.
The contributions of my research may have capacity to help or to harm, and the
realization of these impacts will depend on how methods are shared and applied
and on the surrounding legal, policy, and societal environments.

In my work, this arises in how I address applications areas.
I am excited by how micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) have yielded positive impact
in the form of development of a vibrant hobbyist community that is steadily
transforming cinematography.
I hope to partner with and reinforce this community as I develop robots for
aerial videography.
Likewise, if I continue research related to search and rescue or subterranean
exploration, I will seek to emulate roboticists such as Robin Murphy by
working closely with search and rescue teams or speleological societies.
